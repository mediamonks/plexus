I will provide you with a collection of PDFs containing style and tone-of-voice information for a certain brand.
Your task is to distill these documents into a clear, structured summary of key brand voice and style guidelines specifically useful for generating brand-aligned copy.

**The extracted guidelines MUST**:
- Define the brand's tone of voice clearly (e.g., formal, playful, authoritative).
- Provide explicit stylistic rules (e.g., sentence length, preferred vocabulary, contractions usage).
- Clearly list messaging principles (e.g., how the brand communicates core values, key dos and don'ts).
- Include any specified rules, abbreviations, or terminology provided.
- Be precise, structured, and actionable for immediate use by copywriters or LLMs.

**You MUST NOT**:
- Include any references or pointers to external documents, style guides, or resources.
- Describe or explain the purpose of this summary.
- Include introductory or closing statements such as "This summary is intended...", "Remember to consult...", or anything similar.
- Reference or include sample copy, examples, or specific deliverables.
- Mention character counts or other specifications unrelated to general style rules.

Respond ONLY with the structured guidelines themselves. Do NOT respond conversationally or add any explanatory text.
